A little functional, imperative language. Built on top of JS. Very smooth

Written for educational experiences. I’ve used less than 650 lines of artesian,
Handcrafted, JavaScript code. I’ve implemented it during a boring, rainy week. :). Juno is a dynamic, declerative and functional programming language. I've designed it to provide the best simplicity, but also the most efficiency for dynamic programming. 

### Syntax

Juno's syntax is inspired by python, scala and by Objective-C. I've chosen those syntaxes because they match the requirements for dynamic languages. Juno is implemented in less than 660 Lines of JavaScript. This mustn't mean, it isn't powerful... Juno coveres a huge environment and concepts such: control flow, generic variable assigns, recursive functions, first-order functions, classes, superclasses, a multi-threading system and much more... I'll take you on a little trip for exploring it's syntax.

#### Basics:

Let's start by declaring the traditional hello, world in Juno:

```js
print("Hello, World!")
```

Really simple.

And now let's wrap a program in some awesome loops:

```js
from 1 to 3 with a:
from 1 to 3 with b:
from 1 to 3 with c:
  print(a, b, c)
:::
```
