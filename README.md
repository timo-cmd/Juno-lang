A little functional, imperative language. Built on top of JS. Very smooth

Written for educational experiences. I’ve used less than 650 lines of artesian,
Handcrafted, JavaScript code. I’ve implemented it during a boring, rainy week. :). Juno is a dynamic, declerative and functional programming language. I've designed it to provide the best simplicity, but also the most efficiency for dynamic programming.
